# mooc-jdk8-scala

[MOOC on JDK8 Lambdas by Oracle](http://bit.ly/1dXQfOB)
 
- On this repo, you will find a possible implementation of the homework in Java 8, and in addition a possible implementation in Scala.
- Don't be too harsh, it's the first time I use lambdas and the first time I write some Java in over two years.
- Despite having over two years of Scala experience, I'm by no means an expert on it, so please feel free to suggest any improvements, on either of the implementations.
